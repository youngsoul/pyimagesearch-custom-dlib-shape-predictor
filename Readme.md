# PyImageSearch Custom DLIB Shape Predictor

This repo contains my work going through the PyImageSearch blog post.

The 'resources' directory contains the files from PyImageSearch.

## Notes

I added `display_images_with_parts.py` file that will take the path to the XML file and show the image with the `parts` displayed on the image.

If a model is provided, then the model predictions will be shown in Blue, and the Actual part values will be show in Red.  This can give you a sense for how well the predictor is doing.
